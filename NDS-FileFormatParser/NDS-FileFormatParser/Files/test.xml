<!-- GENERAL FILE INFO SECTION
	 At the moment this section isn't important
	 because I'm just interested in parsing the file.
	 Here there will be some info about the file:
	 tell if it contains text, images, and so on.
	 The user has to say which type of data there is
	 in the file and in which variables are contained
	 the interesting values

<!-- FILE STRUCTURE SECTION
	 In this section the user has to define the
	 variables that the program will read.
	 The sintax for primitive data type is:
		<primitive name   = "Variable name"
                      (the name of the variable must be just
                      one word with no spaces)
		           type   = "data type"
				       offset = "offset of the variable in the file"
                      (optionally: if the user wants to read
                      without jumping inside the file, he can
                      omit it)
				       size   = "size of the variable in bytes"
				              (if the users doesn't define it,
							        the size will be the default value.
							        In some cases it necessary to define
							        the length of the variable: if it
							        isn't the tool will throw a
							        NullArgumentException)
