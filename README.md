NDS-FileFormatParser
====================

Tool that can parse a file, getting its structure from an XML file

It's a test tool that will be used for writing NDS game plugins easily, just writing some XML files.
In these way it will be simpler supporting a lot of NDS games in a tool that edits NDS roms.
